# 4-liters-of-liquid-using-a-5-liter-and-a-3-liter-container
Start with both the 5-liter and 3-liter containers empty.

Fill the 5-liter container completely with liquid.

Pour the liquid from the 5-liter container into the 3-liter container. This will leave 2 liters of liquid in the 5-liter container.

Empty the 3-liter container.

Pour the 2 liters of liquid from the 5-liter container back into the 3-liter container.

Refill the 5-liter container completely with liquid.

Now, you will have 4 liters of liquid in the 5-liter container, and the 3-liter container will have 2 liters of liquid.
